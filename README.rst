Tight is a microframework created and optimized for serverless runtimes. With ``tight-cli`` and ``tight`` you can quickly scaffold serverless applications that are conventional, testable-by-default and free of boilerplate.

**Tight currently supports AWS Lambda and the Python2.7 runtime.**

The best way to get started with Tight is to follow the `tutorial <http://tight-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/tutorial.html>`_, which will guide you through the process of building and deploying an app. There are also references for both `tight <http://tight-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/tight_reference.html>`_ and `tight-cli <http://tight-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/reference.html>`_.
